                    <h3>My Cubing Journey</h3>
                    <h4>How It Started</h4>
                    <p>
                        It all started in 2014 when I was about 15 years old.
                        I was on an overseas school trip and one of the guys
                        who was on the trip had brought along a Rubik's Cube
                        and was playing with it throughout. I had seen cubes
                        before and even had an old scrambled cube sitting at
                        home somewhere, but I had never bothered to learn it
                        properly up until that point. This time though, I
                        finally had the curiosity to find out more, so I asked
                        him about how to solve it. He showed me the beginners'
                        method, and although I didn't have enough time during
                        the trip to fully internalise everything that he
                        taught, it gave me a pretty good idea of how to solve
                        the cube. I didn't touch a cube again until about
                        another year after that though. By the time I got home
                        from the trip, I had already forgotten most of what I
                        had learnt, so it never even crossed my mind to try to
                        find my old cube and practice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A year after that school trip, I was on another trip,
                        this time with family and friends, and my brother had
                        decided to buy a cube for some reason. I think he got
                        inspired by one of our family friends on that trip who
                        was also into cubing and had brought his cube along
                        for the trip. Both me and my brother would try (and
                        fail) to solve the cube that he bought and each time
                        we would keep going back to our friend for help. It
                        was probably this experience of not being able to
                        solve the cube on my own that made me finally decide
                        to properly learn to solve it once and for all. When
                        we got home from this trip, my brother pretty much
                        lost all of his interest in the cube he bought, so he
                        wasn't really using it much. I took the opportunity to
                        borrow the cube from him and looked up a tutorial on
                        YouTube. From there, I started to practice solving the
                        cube until I could do it on my own. And that was it.
                        Once I could solve the cube once, I could do it again
                        and again. And that was how my cubing journey began.
