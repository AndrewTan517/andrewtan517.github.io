          <h3>Coaching Services</h3>
          <p>I'm considering starting my own coaching services for people who may want it. I'm still working out the details and will probably do a trial run first before launching it properly. If you would like to be a part of the trial run, I will set up a form for you to indicate your interest, but until then please wait for a bit.</p>
          <p>In terms of what events I can coach, I can technically coach all events, but do bear in mind that my knowledge will be relatively limited for events that I do not specialise in. With that said, I am currently offering  the following events, though I do accept requests for other events:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>3x3</li>
            <li>2x2</li>
            <li>Clock</li>
            <li>Square-1</li>
            <li>All blind events</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Solve Critiques</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Please upload an average of 5/mean of 3 of the relevant event to YouTube. You may choose to unlist the video if you wish.</li>
            <li>While not required, providing a written reconstruction of the solves either in the video description or a pinned comment would greatly help me.</li>
            <li>I will either respond in written form (default) or video form based on what you have indicated.</li>
            <li>I will do my best to send my response within a week, but occasionally there may be circumstances which may delay my response, so I ask for your understanding in such a scenario.</li>
            <li>If you would like to order multiple solve critiques, please fill in a new form for each order.</li>
            <li>Once paid, no refunds are allowed except under extenuating circumstances.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><a>Order a solve critque</a></p>
          <h4>1-on-1 Coaching</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Coaching sessions are on an hourly basis, so the minimum session duration is 1 hour. If you need to leave early, I will still charge the full hour's worth.</li>
            <li>You may book multiple sessions at one go. Sessions booked across consecutive hours will be treated as one long session spanning multiple hours.</li>
            <li>There will be a 15-minute buffer before and after each session, during which you may choose to start your lesson early or end your lesson late free-of-charge.</li>
            <li>Please make all bookings/cancellations at least 3 days (72 hours) before the start time, or you will not be allowed to book the session/receive a refund.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>My Cubing Journey</h3>
          <h4>How It Started</h4>
          <p>It all started in 2014 when I was about 15 years old. I was on an overseas school trip and one of the guys who was on the trip had brought along a Rubik's Cube and was playing with it throughout. I had seen cubes before and even had an old scrambled cube sitting at home somewhere, but I had never bothered to learn it properly up until that point. This time though, I finally had the curiosity to find out more, so I asked him about how to solve it. He showed me the beginners' method, and although I didn't have enough time during the trip to fully internalise everything that he taught, it gave me a pretty good idea of how to solve the cube. I didn't touch a cube again until about another year after that though. By the time I got home from the trip, I had already forgotten most of what I had learnt, so it never even crossed my mind to try to find my old cube and practice.</p>
          <p>A year after that school trip, I was on another trip, this time with family and friends, and my brother had decided to buy a cube for some reason. I think he got inspired by one of our family friends on that trip who was also into cubing and had brought his cube along for the trip. Both me and my brother would try (and fail) to solve the cube that he bought and each time we would keep going back to our friend for help. It was probably this experience of not being able to solve the cube on my own that made me finally decide to properly learn to solve it once and for all. When we got home from this trip, my brother pretty much lost all of his interest in the cube he bought, so he wasn't really using it much. I took the opportunity to borrow the cube from him and looked up a tutorial on YouTube. From there, I started to practice solving the cube until I could do it on my own. And that was it. Once I could solve the cube once, I could do it again and again. And that was how my cubing journey began.</p>
